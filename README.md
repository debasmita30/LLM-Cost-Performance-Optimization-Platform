A production-grade, multi-objective optimization system for evaluating Large Language Model (LLM) deployment strategies under cost and SLA constraints.

[![Live Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live-Demo-success?style=for-the-badge&logo=render)](https://llm-cost-performance-optimization-platform.streamlit.app/)

This platform simulates LLM configurations and performs:

Cost–accuracy tradeoff analysis

Pareto frontier extraction

SLA-constrained optimization

Dual-objective solving (Accuracy − λ₁Cost − λ₂Latency)

Monte Carlo stability testing

Deployment cost forecasting

Executive-level reporting dashboard

Built for real-world LLM production decision systems.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

LLM deployment requires balancing:

Accuracy

API Cost

Latency

SLA compliance

Monthly infrastructure budget

This system provides a structured optimization framework to make those decisions mathematically grounded and deployment-ready.

## ⚙️ Core Features
1️⃣ Multi-Objective Optimization

Objective function:

Objective = Accuracy − λ × Cost

Extended dual-objective:

Dual Objective = Accuracy_norm − λ₁Cost_norm − λ₂Latency_norm

Supports:

Adjustable λ weights

Budget filtering

SLA constraints

2️⃣ Pareto Frontier Extraction

Efficient O(n log n) Pareto solver:

Identifies non-dominated configurations

Highlights cost-efficient accuracy tradeoffs

Interactive visualization

3️⃣ SLA-Constrained Optimization

Filters configurations by:

Latency ≤ SLA Threshold

Then re-optimizes under constraint.

Outputs:

Best SLA-compliant configuration

SLA violation rate

Risk categorization

4️⃣ Monte Carlo Robustness Testing

Simulates stochastic accuracy noise:

20-run stability test

Mean & Std deviation per model

Reliability benchmarking

5️⃣ Deployment Cost Forecasting

Monthly projection:

Monthly Cost = Cost_per_request × Daily_Queries × 30

Provides:

Real-time cost forecasting

Executive budgeting insight

6️⃣ Advanced Visual Analytics

Interactive Streamlit dashboard includes:

Pareto scatter plot

Lambda tradeoff curve

Model radar comparison

Cost-per-correct heatmap

SLA risk pie chart

3D Cost–Latency–Accuracy visualization

Dual-objective optimizer output

Executive summary panel
